# Dominoes by Amadaya Michael

## How to use:
### Console version
The system prints out options for the player. Typing in an option other than the three designated ones prints and error message and returns.
### GUI version
Buttons at the bottom represent dominoes. Clicking checks for the validity of the selected play. Pass and draw from Boneyard buttons are at the top and will go through checks when clicked before performing the intended functions.
## Testing/Debugging
### Console version
System prints out different messages if an invalid play is selected, ie a domino
    that doesn't match either side of the active board, or if there is a valid
    play in the hand when the human attempts to draw from the Boneyard.
## Known issues
### Console version
Doesn't currently run but the code is there
### GUI version
